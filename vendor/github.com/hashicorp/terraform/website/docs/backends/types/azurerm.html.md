  Terraform can store state remotely in Azure Blob Storage.

# azurerm

**Kind: Standard (with state locking)**

Stores the state as a Blob with the given Key within the Blob Container within [the Blob Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction). This backend also supports state locking and consistency checking via native capabilities of Azure Blob Storage.

## Example Configuration

When authenticating using the Azure CLI or a Service Principal:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

When authenticating using Managed Service Identity (MSI):

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
    use_msi              = true
    subscription_id  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    tenant_id        = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}
```

When authenticating using the Access Key associated with the Storage Account:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"

    # rather than defining this inline, the Access Key can also be sourced
    # from an Environment Variable - more information is available below.
    access_key = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789..."
  }
}
```

When authenticating using a SAS Token associated with the Storage Account:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"

    # rather than defining this inline, the SAS Token can also be sourced
    # from an Environment Variable - more information is available below.
    sas_token = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789..."
  }
}
```

-> **NOTE:** When using a Service Principal or an Access Key - we recommend using a [Partial Configuration](/docs/backends/config.html) for the credentials.

## Example Referencing

When authenticating using a Service Principal:

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    storage_account_name = "terraform123abc"
    container_name       = "terraform-state"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

When authenticating using Managed Service Identity (MSI):

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    storage_account_name = "terraform123abc"
    container_name       = "terraform-state"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
    use_msi              = true
    subscription_id  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    tenant_id        = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}
```

When authenticating using the Access Key associated with the Storage Account:

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    storage_account_name = "terraform123abc"
    container_name       = "terraform-state"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"

    # rather than defining this inline, the Access Key can also be sourced
    # from an Environment Variable - more information is available below.
    access_key = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789..."
  }
}
```

When authenticating using a SAS Token associated with the Storage Account:

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    storage_account_name = "terraform123abc"
    container_name       = "terraform-state"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"

    # rather than defining this inline, the SAS Token can also be sourced
    # from an Environment Variable - more information is available below.
    sas_token = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789..."
  }
}
```
